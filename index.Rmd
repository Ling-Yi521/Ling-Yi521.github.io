**Brief Introduction**

I am a 2nd year masters student at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health in the Department of Epidmiology with a certificate in toxicology. I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science from the Univeristy of Scranton majoring in Biology and Philosophy. Below is a picture of my dog that my family adopted six years ago. Her name is Maya.
